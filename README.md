# Parallel-Euclidean-Hierachical-Minimum-Spanning-Forest-and-Minimum-Spanning-Tree
This methods combines Benley's spiral search and Borůvka's algorithm. We use massively parallel local spiral search to find each component's closest outgoing vertex in parallel, apply parallel Breadth-first Search algorithm to find Borůvka's shortest outgoing edge.
The original idea and this code is from Wenbao-QIAO, email: rapidbao@gmail.com , Now, this codes are not complete, the basic library used this version has copyright from other project. We are trying to upload a new version.
To be continued...
We thank for the theoratical implementation help from Jean-charles Créput.
